RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.

Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.

## Why is computer memory (RAM) important?

Computer random access memory (RAM) is one of the most important components in determining your system’s performance. RAM gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis. It stores the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly. 

The more programs your system is running, the more you’ll need. SSDs (solid state drives) are also important components and will help your system reach its peak performance.

The speed and performance of your system directly correlate to the amount of RAM you have installed. If your system has too little RAM, it can be slow and sluggish. But on the opposite end, you can install too much with little to no added benefit. There are ways to see if your computer needs more memory, and to make sure you are buying memory that is compatible with the other components in your system. Generally, components are created to the highest standard at the time of manufacture, but with the expectation that technology will continue to change.

## What does RAM (memory) do?

RAM is temporary storage that goes away when the power turns off. So what is RAM used for, then? It’s very fast, which makes it ideal for things the computer is actively working on, such as applications that are currently running (for example, the web browser in which you’re reading this article) and the data those applications work on or with (such as this article).

It can help to think about RAM with the analogy of a physical desktop. Your working space — where you scribble on something immediately — is the top of the desk, where you want everything within arm’s reach and you want no delay in finding anything. That’s RAM. In contrast, if you want to keep anything to work on later, you put it into a desk drawer — or store it on a hard disk, either locally or in the cloud.

## What uses RAM?

RAM is used to store information that needs to be used quickly. This means that opening many programs, running various processes or accessing multiple files simultaneously is likely to use a lot of RAM. Particularly complexed programs like games or design software will use most RAM.
